<p>“WOW! After years of searching I finally found my hair guru! I’ve been trying to find a “master stylist” without having to fly to NYC. I was searching the web and by accident or actually luck, I found Raffaele, and even luckier he wasn’t clear across town!! I met with him a few months ago and he wouldn’t cut my hair until it grew out. My past hair cuts were always the same...no style or flair but a trim on the bottom and angled on the sides and huge gaps where they tried to take out the bulk by thinning. Anyone with curly hair understands you have to treat it differently than those with straight hair.

    After 2 months of having my hair grow out , I finally met with Raffaele yesterday. He asked how I wanted it cut. Thinking good or bad I needed a decent haircut so I shut my eyes and said he was in charge. Took a while but he cut my hair with precision and an attitude that everyone that leaves his chair represents his brand. He has a lot of pride and attention to detail with every cut and in the end it was the best hair cut I’ve ever had in my life! You bet I’m a customer for life and now that I’m familiar with his work I’ll be back for hair color and highlights. Can’t wait!!
    
    If you’re looking for “the one” give Raffaele a try. He will listen to you but also listen to him. He does know what he’s doing and is the “master “ I was looking for.”
